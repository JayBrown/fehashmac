What is RIPEMD-160?

RIPEMD-160 is a 160-bit cryptographic hash function, designed by Hans
Dobbertin, Antoon Bosselaers, and Bart Preneel. It is intended to be used as
a secure replacement for the 128-bit hash functions MD4, MD5, and RIPEMD.
MD4 and MD5 were developed by Ron Rivest for RSA Data Security, while RIPEMD
was developed in the framework of the EU project RIPE (RACE Integrity
Primitives Evaluation, 1988-1992). There are two good reasons to consider
such a replacement:

   * A 128-bit hash result does not offer sufficient protection anymore. A
     brute force collision search attack on a 128-bit hash result requires
     264 or about 2.1019 evaluations of the function. In 1994 Paul van
     Oorschot and Mike Wiener showed that this brute-force job can be done
     in less than a month with a $10 million investment (``Parallel
     collision search with applications to hash functions and discrete
     logarithms,'' 2nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications
     Security, ACM Press, 1994, pp. 210-218). This cost is expected to halve
     every 18 months.
   * In the first half of 1995 Hans Dobbertin found collisions for a version
     of RIPEMD restricted to two rounds out of three. Using similar
     techniques Hans produced in the Fall of 1995 collisions for (all 3
     rounds of) MD4. The attack on MD4 requires only a few seconds on a PC,
     and still leaves some freedom as to the choice of the message, clearly
     ruling out MD4 as a collision resistant hash function. Shortly
     afterwards, in the Spring of 1996, Hans also found collisions for the
     compression function of MD5. Although not yet extended to collisions
     for MD5 itself, this attack casts serious doubts on the strength of MD5
     as a collision resistant hash function. RSA Data Security, for which
     Ron Rivest developed MD4 and MD5, recommend that MD4 should not longer
     be used, and that MD5 should not be used for future applications that
     require the hash function to be collision-resistant.

RIPEMD-160 is a strengthened version of RIPEMD with a 160-bit hash result,
and is expected to be secure for the next ten years or more. The design
philosophy is to build as much as possible on experience gained by
evaluating MD4, MD5, and RIPEMD. Like its predecessors, RIPEMD-160 is tuned
for 32-bit processors, which we feel will remain important in the coming
decade.

RIPEMD-128 is a plug-in substitute for RIPEMD (or MD4 and MD5, for that
matter) with a 128-bit result. In view of the result of Paul van Oorschot
and Mike Wiener mentioned earlier, 128-bit hash results do not offer
sufficient protection for the next ten years, and applications using 128-bit
hash functions should consider upgrading to a 160-bit hash function.

RIPEMD-256 and RIPEMD-320 are optional extensions of, respectively,
RIPEMD-128 and RIPEMD-160, and are intended for applications of hash
functions that require a longer hash result without needing a larger
security level.

And what about SHA-1?

An alternative to RIPEMD-160 is SHA-1. It also has a 160-bit hash result,
and because of some of its properties it is quite likely that it is not
vulnerable to the known attacks on the MD4-like hash functions. However, and
in contrast to RIPEMD-160, both its design criteria and the attack on the
first version are secret. A theoretical attack on the compression function
of the first version with complexity 261 was found by Florent Chabaud and
Antoine Joux, ``Differential Collisions in SHA-0,'' Advances in Cryptology -
Crypto'98, LNCS 1462, H. Krawczyk, Ed., Springer-Verlag, 1998, pp. 56-71.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
How fast is RIPEMD-160?

The following table gives an idea of the performance of the different
MD4-like hash functions. The implementations are written in 80x86 assembly
language and are optimized for the Pentium processor. It is assumed that
both code and data resides in the on-chip caches. Under these conditions the
cycle figures are independent of the clock speed, and the throughput figures
scale with the clock speed.

Optional extensions to 256 and 320 hash results: RIPEMD-256 and RIPEMD-320

Some applications of hash functions require a longer hash result without
needing a larger security level. To this end RIPEMD-256 and RIPEMD-320 are
constructed from, respectively, RIPEMD-128 and RIPEMD-160 by initializing
the two parallel lines with different initial values, omitting the
combination of the two lines at the end of every application of the
compression function, and exchanging a chaining variable between the 2
parallel lines after each round. Remark that the security level of the
320-bit extension of RIPEMD-160 is only guaranteed to be the same as that of
RIPEMD-160 itself, and similarly for the 256-bit extension of RIPEMD-128
with respect to RIPEMD-128 itself.

Pseudocode for RIPEMD-256 and RIPEMD-320 are provided for, as well as test
vectors, which are given in the tables below. The messages are given in
ASCII format, while the corresponding hash results are in hexadecimal
format.

MACs based on RIPEMD-160.

Two constructions of MACs based on a hash-function are currently being
standardized within ISO/IEC (DIS 9797-2). A reference implementation and
test vectors are given for MDx-MAC based on RIPEMD-160/128, test vectors are
given for HMAC based on RIPEMD-160/128.

1. MDx-MAC for RIPEMD-160.

At Crypto'95 Bart Preneel and Paul van Oorschot proposed a new generic
construction (MDx-MAC) for transforming any secure hash function of the
MD4-family into a secure MAC of equal or smaller bitlength and comparable
speed. Reference C software for the MDx-MACs based on RIPEMD-160 and
RIPEMD-128 is now available. Like for the corresponding hash functions the
implementations are written for the sole purpose of documentation. No
optimization whatsoever is performed: only readability and portability were
kept in mind.

2. HMAC-RIPEMD-160: testvectors.

The HMAC-construction was proposed by Mihit Bellare, Ran Canetti, and Hugo
Krawczyck, ``Keying Hash Functions for Message Authentication,'' Advances in
Cryptology - Crypto'96, LNCS 1109, N. Koblitz, Ed., Springer-Verlag, 1996,
pp. 1-15. Test vectors for two different keys (both in hexadecimal format)
are given in the table below. The messages are given in ASCII format, while
the corresponding MAC results are in hexadecimal format (the full length
result is given). Keys are required to be at least the size of the hash
result. Another source for test vectors is RFC 2286, ``Test cases for
HMAC-RIPEMD160 and HMAC-RIPEMD128,'' Internet Request for Comments 2286, J.
Kapp, February 1998.

OAEP-encoding based on RIPEMD-160: test vectors

The OAEP (Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding) encoding method is
parametrized by the choice of the hash function and mask generation
function. This section lists test vectors for OAEP based on RIPEMD-160 and
the mask generation function MGF1 as defined in PKCS #1 v2.0 and IEEE P1363
with RIPEMD-160 as the hash function. Inputs to the OAEP encoding method are

   * the message to be encoded
   * a string detailing encoding parameters
   * the intended length in bytes of the encoded message
   * a random string of 20 bytes long

All strings are given in hexadecimal format.

                                                         OAEP-encoded message string for
           Encoding parameters                      message to be encoded = 54859b342c49ea2a,
                                                  intended length of encoded message = 63 bytes,
